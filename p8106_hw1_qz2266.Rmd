### Data Import
In this exercise, we predict the sale price of a house using its other characteristics. The
training data are in “housing train.csv”, and the test data are in “housing test.csv”.
```{r}
# read in training data
train = read.csv("data/housing_training.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names()
train = na.omit(train)

# read in test data
test = read.csv("data/housing_test.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names()
test = na.omit(test)
```
